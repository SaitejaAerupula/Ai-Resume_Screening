## IEEE Style Research Paper for B.Tech Academic Project

---

## Abstract

**Background:** Traditional resume screening processes are time-consuming, subjective, and often inefficient in identifying the most suitable candidates for specific job positions. Manual evaluation of large volumes of resumes leads to inconsistencies and potential human bias in candidate selection.

**Objective:** This research presents an innovative AI-powered resume screening system that leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP), vector similarity search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to automate and enhance the candidate evaluation process.

**Methodology:** The system employs state-of-the-art transformer models including sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for semantic embeddings, facebook/bart-large-cnn for text summarization, and distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad for question-answering. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is utilized for efficient vector indexing and similarity-based retrieval. The system implements a multi-factor scoring algorithm that combines semantic similarity (40%), skill matching (40%), and experience level alignment (20%) for position-specific candidate ranking.

**Results:** The implemented system demonstrates superior performance in automating resume screening with capabilities for batch processing multiple resumes, intelligent skill extraction, experience level analysis, and position-specific candidate ranking. The web-based interface provides real-time processing and interactive query capabilities.

**Conclusion:** The AI-powered resume screening system significantly reduces manual effort while improving the accuracy and consistency of candidate evaluation. The system shows promising potential for scalable deployment in enterprise recruitment processes.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

In today's competitive job market, organizations receive hundreds to thousands of resumes for each position, making manual screening an increasingly challenging and resource-intensive process. Traditional resume screening methods suffer from several limitations:

- **Time Complexity:** Manual review of large resume volumes requires significant human resources
- **Subjectivity:** Human evaluators may introduce unconscious bias and inconsistency
- **Scalability Issues:** Traditional methods do not scale effectively with increasing application volumes
- **Limited Search Capabilities:** Keyword-based matching fails to capture semantic relationships
- **Inefficient Ranking:** Lack of standardized scoring mechanisms for candidate comparison

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The primary challenge in modern recruitment is the development of an intelligent, scalable, and unbiased system that can:
1. Process multiple resumes simultaneously with high accuracy
2. Extract and analyze candidate skills and experience levels
3. Rank candidates based on position-specific requirements
4. Provide natural language query capabilities for complex candidate searches
5. Maintain consistency and objectivity in evaluation criteria
